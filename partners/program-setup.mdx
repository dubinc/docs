  </Step>
</Steps>

### Getting started details

In the first step, you'll configure:

**Program basics** – Set your company name and upload a logo that will appear on your partner portal and landing page.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/partners/program-basics-name-logo.png"
    alt="Program basics - company name and logo"
  />
</Frame>

**Referral link** – Choose a domain for your partner links (claim a free .link domain or connect your own) and set the destination URL.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/partners/program-basics-referral-link.png"
    alt="Program basics - referral link domain and website URL"
  />
</Frame>

**Website URL** – Set where visitors will be redirected when they click on partner referral links.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/partners/program-basics-website-url.png"
    alt="Program basics - website URL and referral link preview"
  />
</Frame>

### Configure rewards details

In the second step, you'll set up your default reward configuration:

**Reward type** – Choose whether to reward partners for sales (purchases and subscriptions) or leads (signups).

**Commission structure** – Select one-off payments or recurring commissions for subscription-based products. For recurring rewards, set the duration (e.g., 12 months).

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/partners/configure-rewards-type.png"
    alt="Configure rewards - reward type and commission structure"
  />
</Frame>

**Reward amount** – Set the commission as a percentage of the sale or a flat dollar amount per conversion.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/partners/configure-rewards-amount.png"
    alt="Configure rewards - reward structure and amount"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  After creating your program, you can set up custom reward rules, partner groups, and dual-sided incentives. See [Advanced reward options](#advanced-reward-options) below.
</Tip>

### Invite partners

In the third step, you can invite your first partners by email. Enter their email addresses and they'll receive an invitation to join your program.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/partners/invite-partners.png"
    alt="Invite partners - add partner emails"
  />
</Frame>

You can also skip this step and invite partners later from your program dashboard, or set up a public landing page where partners can apply to join.

### Help and Support details

In the fourth step, configure support resources that will be displayed to partners in their dashboard:

- **Support email** (required) – Where partners can reach you with questions
- **Help center URL** – Link to your documentation or FAQ
- **Terms of Service URL** – Your affiliate/partner program terms

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/partners/help-and-support.png"
    alt="Help and Support - support email and resource URLs"
  />
</Frame>

### Overview

The final step displays a summary of your program configuration. Review your reward structure, referral link format, and website URL before clicking **Create program**.

    src="/images/partners/program-overview.png"
    alt="Overview - program summary before creation"
  />
</Frame>

## How conversion tracking powers your program

Partner commissions are automatically calculated when conversions are tracked. The flow works like this: a customer clicks a partner link → the SDK stores a cookie → you track lead and sale events → Dub calculates the commission based on your reward rules.

<Tip>
  For a detailed explanation of the click→cookie→lead→sale flow, attribution models, and troubleshooting, see [How attribution works](/partners/how-attribution-works).
</Tip>

## Importing from other platforms

If you're migrating from another affiliate platform, you can import your existing partners and historical conversion data:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="From Rewardful" icon="right-from-bracket" href="/guides/migrating/migrating-from-rewardful">
    Import partners, links, and conversion history
  </Card>
  <Card title="From PartnerStack" icon="right-from-bracket" href="/guides/migrating/migrating-from-partnerstack">
    Migrate your affiliate program
  </Card>
  <Card title="From FirstPromoter" icon="right-from-bracket" href="/guides/migrating/migrating-from-firstpromoter">
    Transfer partners and commissions
  </Card>
  <Card title="From Tolt" icon="right-from-bracket" href="/guides/migrating/migrating-from-tolt">
    Import your referral program
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  When importing historical conversions, partners will receive credit for past sales and commissions will be calculated based on your current reward rules.
</Tip>

## Setting up payouts

To pay your partners, you'll need to connect your bank account to Dub:

1. Navigate to your [program settings](https://app.dub.co/settings/payouts)
2. Connect your bank account for outgoing payments
3. Configure payout frequency (manual or automatic)

Dub supports 1-click global payouts to partners in 130+ countries. Payouts are processed through connected bank accounts (availability varies by country and banking rails).

For detailed instructions, see [How to set up your bank account](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-set-up-bank-account).

## Inviting partners

There are two ways to grow your partner network:

### Direct invitations

Invite specific partners via email directly from your program dashboard. This is ideal for:
- Existing customers you want to turn into affiliates
- Influencers or content creators you've identified
- Strategic partners with established audiences

<Card title="Inviting partners" icon="envelope" href="https://dub.co/help/article/inviting-partners">
  Send targeted invitations to high-value partners you've already identified
</Card>

### Program landing page

Create a public landing page where anyone can apply to join your program. Configure:
- Program description and benefits
- Commission structure overview
- Application requirements
- Custom branding

Partners who apply through your landing page will appear in your applications queue for approval.

<Card title="Program landing page" icon="browser" href="https://dub.co/help/article/program-landing-page">
  Scale your program with a public page that attracts partners organically
</Card>

## Advanced reward options

After your program is created, you can configure more sophisticated reward structures:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Partner rewards" icon="gift" href="https://dub.co/help/article/partner-rewards">
    Custom commission rules based on LTV, product categories, or performance tiers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Partner groups" icon="users-gear" href="https://dub.co/help/article/partner-groups">
    Tiered programs (Bronze, Silver, Gold) with different commission rates per group
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dual-sided incentives" icon="handshake" href="/partners/link-based-discounts">
    Offer customer discounts through partner links to boost conversion rates
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## White-labeling the partner experience

Embed the partner dashboard directly in your application so users can join your partner program without leaving your site:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Embedded referrals" icon="window" href="/partners/embedded-referrals">
    Set up a white-labeled referral dashboard inside your app with secure embed tokens
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This creates a seamless experience where your users can:
- Enroll in your partner program
- Access their unique referral links
- Track their conversions and earnings
- Request payouts

All without being redirected to an external dashboard.
