og:title: "Dub Partners – External payouts"
---

External payouts allow you to process partner payments through your own internal systems while still leveraging Dub's tracking, commission calculation, and partner management features.

This is useful if you:
- Already have an existing payout infrastructure
- Need to use a specific payment provider not supported by Dub
- Want to consolidate all payouts through a single system
- Have custom compliance or regulatory requirements

## Payout modes

Dub supports three payout modes for your partner program:

### Internal (default)

All partners are paid directly by Dub through Stripe Connect. This is the simplest option and requires no additional setup beyond [connecting your bank account](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-set-up-bank-account).

### Hybrid (recommended)

Partners with connected bank accounts are paid directly by Dub, while all other partners with tenant IDs configured receive payouts via the `payout.confirmed` webhook event.

This mode offers the best of both worlds:
- Partners who prefer direct bank transfers can connect their accounts
- You maintain control over payouts for partners without bank accounts
- Gradual migration path if you're transitioning from external to internal payouts

### External only

All payouts are processed through the `payout.confirmed` webhook event to your platform. Dub handles commission tracking and payout calculations, but you're responsible for the actual money transfer.

## How external payouts work

The external payout flow follows these steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Payout confirmed on Dub">
When a payout period ends and you confirm the payout in your Dub dashboard, eligible external payouts are marked as confirmed.
</Step>

<Step title="Webhook event sent">
Once payment is received by Dub (for hybrid mode) or immediately after confirmation (for external-only mode), Dub sends a `payout.confirmed` webhook event for each external payout.
</Step>

<Step title="Process the webhook">
Your webhook receiver processes the event and initiates the payout through your internal systems using the partner's `tenantId` to identify them.
</Step>

<Step title="Payout status updated">
Based on the webhook delivery status:
- **Success (200-299 response)**: Payout is marked as `completed`
- **Failure (non-2xx response or timeout)**: Payout is marked as `failed` with the failure reason

If the webhook fails after all retries, you'll need to manually process the payout and update its status in your dashboard.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Setting up external payouts

### 1. Configure payout mode

Navigate to your program's payout settings and select either **Hybrid** or **External only** mode.

<Note>
External payout modes require an active webhook subscribed to the `payout.confirmed` event. You'll be prompted to set one up if you haven't already.
</Note>

### 2. Set up webhook receiver

Create a webhook endpoint that listens for the `payout.confirmed` event. See our [webhook setup guide](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) for detailed instructions.

Your webhook endpoint should:
1. Verify the webhook signature to ensure it's from Dub
2. Extract the payout and partner information from the payload
3. Initiate the payout through your payment system
4. Return a 2xx status code on success

Here's an example webhook handler:

```typescript
import { Dub } from "dub";

const dub = new Dub();

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const body = await req.text();
  const signature = req.headers.get("dub-signature");

  // Verify webhook signature
  const event = dub.webhooks.verify(body, signature);

  if (event.event === "payout.confirmed") {
    const { partner, amount, currency, id } = event.data;

    // Process payout through your system
    await processExternalPayout({
      tenantId: partner.tenantId,
      amount: amount / 100, // Convert from cents
      currency,
      payoutId: id,
    });

    return new Response("OK", { status: 200 });
  }

  return new Response("Event not handled", { status: 200 });
}
```

### 3. Configure partner tenant IDs

For external payouts to work, each partner must have a `tenantId` configured. This is your internal identifier for the partner in your system.

You can set the tenant ID when:
- [Creating a partner via API](/api-reference/endpoint/create-a-partner)
- Updating a partner in your dashboard
- Importing partners from another platform

<Warning>
Partners without a `tenantId` will not receive external payouts. In hybrid mode, they'll need to connect a bank account to receive payments directly from Dub.
</Warning>

## Webhook payload

The `payout.confirmed` webhook event contains the following information:

<CodeGroup>
```json payout-confirmed.json
{
  "id": "evt_...",
  "event": "payout.confirmed",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-22T15:50:13.661Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "po_1K869T6CWEH4NB78NS3QYHDJE",
    "invoiceId": "inv_1K94KX5ZWHTWFG07NP96AY90F",
    "amount": 5000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "completed",
    "description": "Dub Partners payout (Acme)",
    "periodStart": "2025-10-22T15:49:33.343Z",
    "periodEnd": "2025-10-31T18:29:59.999Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-22T15:50:13.661Z",
    "paidAt": null,
    "mode": "external",
    "partner": {
      "id": "cm6v2l38p000zubyl5fly3i7w",
      "name": "Matthew Hayden",
      "email": "matthew@example.com",
      "image": null,
      "country": "US",
      "tenantId": "64dc9a8c-5cf9-4446-b53b-cdc15199fafc",
      "status": "approved"
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Key fields:
- `amount`: Payout amount in cents
- `currency`: Currency code (e.g., "USD")
- `partner.tenantId`: Your internal identifier for the partner
- `periodStart` / `periodEnd`: The commission period this payout covers
- `mode`: Will be "external" for external payouts

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Implement idempotency">
Use the `id` field from the webhook payload as an idempotency key to prevent duplicate payouts if the webhook is retried.

```typescript
const payoutId = event.data.id;

// Check if payout already processed
const existing = await db.payouts.findUnique({
  where: { dubPayoutId: payoutId }
});

if (existing) {
  return new Response("Already processed", { status: 200 });
}

// Process payout...
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Handle webhook failures gracefully">
Return appropriate HTTP status codes:
- `200-299`: Payout processed successfully
- `400-499`: Invalid request (won't be retried)
- `500-599`: Server error (will be retried)

Log all webhook events for debugging and reconciliation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reconcile payouts regularly">
Periodically compare payouts in your system with Dub's records to catch any discrepancies. You can use the [Commissions API](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-commissions) to fetch payout data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Monitor webhook health">
Set up alerts for webhook failures in your [webhook settings](https://app.dub.co/settings/webhooks). Dub will automatically disable webhooks after 20 consecutive failures.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Webhook not receiving events">
1. Verify your webhook is subscribed to the `payout.confirmed` event
2. Check that your webhook URL is publicly accessible
3. Ensure your endpoint returns a 2xx status code
4. Review webhook logs in your [webhook settings](https://app.dub.co/settings/webhooks)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Partner not receiving external payouts">
1. Verify the partner has a `tenantId` configured
2. Check that your program's payout mode is set to Hybrid or External
3. Ensure the partner meets the minimum payout threshold
4. Confirm the partner's status is "approved"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Payout marked as failed">
Check the failure reason in your dashboard. Common causes:
- Webhook endpoint returned non-2xx status code
- Webhook endpoint timed out (30 second limit)
- Webhook endpoint is unreachable

You can manually mark the payout as completed once you've processed it externally.
