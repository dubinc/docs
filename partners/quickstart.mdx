<Note>
  Dub Partners require a [Business plan](https://dub.co/pricing) subscription or
  higher.
</Note>

[Dub Partners](https://dub.co/partners) lets you build powerful, scalable referral and affiliate programs with 1-click global payouts and white-labeling functionality.

## Step 1: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK

First, install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction). This script captures click attribution by storing a first-party cookie that links conversions back to the referring partner.

<Tip>
  For a detailed explanation of the click→cookie→lead→sale flow, see [How attribution works](/partners/how-attribution-works).
</Tip>

The SDK also supports:

- [Client-side click tracking](/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking) via query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`)
- [Fetching partner and discount data](/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking#automatically-fetching-partner-and-discount-data) for [dual-sided incentives](https://dub.co/help/article/dual-sided-incentives)

<DubClientInstall />

<DubClientInstallVerify />

Once the script is installed, make sure to verify that [client-side click tracking](/sdks/client-side/features/click-tracking) is working as expected by checking if the following is true:

<VerifyTrackClick />

In case you missed it, you'll also need to allowlist your site's domain to ensure the client-side click events are ingested by Dub. Navigate to your workspace's Analytics settings page and add your site's domain to the **Allowed Hostnames** list.

<OpenAnalyticsSettings />

</Frame>

<Tip>
  When testing things out locally, you can add `localhost` to the **Allowed
  Hostnames** list temporarily. This will allow local events to be ingested by
  Dub. Don't forget to remove it once you're ready to go live!
</Tip>

## Alternative: Use a native integration

Instead of the manual server-side SDK setup in Step 2, you can use one of our native integrations to track conversions automatically:

If you use Stripe or Shopify, you can skip Step 2 and proceed directly to [Step 3: Set up your partner program](#step-3-set-up-your-partner-program).

## Step 2: Install the Dub server-side SDK + track conversion events

<InstallServerSdksTrackConversions />

## Step 3: Set up your partner program

Once you have conversion tracking up and running, you can follow these steps to set up your partner program:

<OpenProgramDashboard />

1. Go through the program onboarding flow to create your program.
   - If you're migrating from another platform, you can also import your partners and historical conversions (e.g. [from Rewardful](https://dub.co/help/article/migrating-from-rewardful)).
2. [Connect your bank account](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-set-up-bank-account) for partner payouts.
3. [Invite your partners](https://dub.co/help/article/inviting-partners) to join your program + set up a branded [program landing page](https://dub.co/help/article/program-landing-page) for future partners.
4. Create [custom reward rules](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-rewards) and [dual-sided incentives](https://dub.co/help/article/dual-sided-incentives) to incentivize partners to share your link with others.
5. Set up a [whitelabeled referral dashboard](/partners/embedded-referrals) that lives directly inside your app so your users can automatically enroll in your partner program without leaving your app.

<Tip>
  For a comprehensive guide on program configuration including conversion tracking integration, see [Partner program setup](/partners/program-setup).
