<SalesIntro />

In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sales conversion events for a SaaS application that uses Segment to track conversions.

<ConversionTrackingPrerequisites />

If you’ve already set up the Dub (Actions) destination, you can skip the first two steps and jump straight to the Add Mapping section.

## Configure Segment Action

Next, configure [Segment Dub (Actions)](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/destinations/catalog/actions-dub) to track sales conversion events.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Add Dub (Actions) destination">

    Head to [Segment Dub (Actions)](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/destinations/catalog/actions-dub) and add the destination to your Segment workspace.

        width="1440"
        height="1024"
      />

    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Dub API Key">

    In the Dub (Actions) destination settings, fill out the following fields:

    - **Name:** Enter a name to help you identify this destination in Segment.
    - **API Key:** Enter your Dub API key. You can find this in the [Dub Dashboard](https://app.dub.co/settings/tokens).
    - **Enable Destination:** Toggle this on to allow Segment to send data to Dub.

    Once completed, click **Save Changes**.

        width="1440"
        height="1024"
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Mapping">

    Next, you’ll choose the **Track a sale** action from the list of available actions.

    By default, this action is configured to send sale data to Dub when the **Event Name** is **Order Completed**.

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/conversions/segment/segment-track-sale-action.png"
        alt="Segment Dub (Actions) Mapping"
        width="1440"
        height="1024"
      />
    </Frame>

    Below the selected action, you’ll see the mapping for that action.

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/conversions/segment/segment-track-sale-mapping.png"
        alt="Segment Dub (Actions) Mapping"
        width="1440"
        height="1024"
      />
    </Frame>

    You can customize the trigger and mapping to fit the specific needs of your application.

    Finally, click **Next** and then **Save and enable** to add the mapping to the destination.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Send sale events to Dub">

    On the server side, you’ll use the `@segment/analytics-node` SDK to send sale events to Segment.

    Make sure to include relevant properties such as `userId`, `payment_processor`, `order_id`, `currency`, and `revenue` in the payload.

    ```tsx
    import { Analytics } from "@segment/analytics-node";

    const segment = new Analytics({
      writeKey: "<YOUR_SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY>",
    });

    segment.track({
      userId: id,
      event: "Order Completed",
      properties: {
        payment_processor: "stripe",
        order_id: "ORD_123",
        currency: "USD",
        revenue: 1000,
      },
      integrations: {
        All: true,
      },
    });
    ```

    Once the event is tracked, Segment will forward the sale data to Dub based on the mappings you’ve configured.

  </Step>
