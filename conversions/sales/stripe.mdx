In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sale events with Stripe as the payment processor by leveraging Dub's Stripe integration.

## Installing the Dub Stripe integration

Dub comes with a powerful Stripe integration that automatically listens to payment events on Stripe and track them as sales on Dub.

Here's how you can install the Dub Stripe integration:

<Steps>
<Step title="Find Dub on the Stripe App Marketplace">
 Navigate to the [Dub Stripe Integration](https://d.to/stripe/app) on the Stripe App Marketplace.
 
<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-marketplace.png"
    alt="The Dub integration page on the Stripe App Marketplace"
  />
</Frame>

</Step>
<Step title="Install the Stripe app">
  On the top right, click on **Install app** to install the Dub app on your Stripe account.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-install.png"
    alt="The Stripe integration installation flow"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Alternatively, you can also install the Stripe app in a [Stripe
  sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes) first to test your end-to-end flow
  without involving real money.
</Tip>

Once the app is installed, click on **Continue to app settings** to finish the installation.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-install-continue.png"
    alt="Continue to app settings"
  />
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Connect Stripe to your Dub workspace">

In the app settings page, click on **Connect workspace** to connect your Stripe account with your Dub workspace.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-connect-workspace.png"
    alt="Connect Stripe to Dub"
  />
</Frame>

This will redirect you to the [Dub OAuth flow](/integrations/quickstart), where you can select the Dub workspace you want to connect to your Stripe account.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/select-dub-workspace.png"
    alt="Select the Dub workspace you want to connect to your Stripe account"
  />
</Frame>

Once you click on **Authorize**, you will be redirected back to the Dub app settings page on Stripe, where you should see that the integration is now installed.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-installed.png"
    alt="The Stripe integration is now installed"
  />
</Frame>

</Step>

</Steps>

Once the integration is installed, Dub will automatically listen to the following events on Stripe and track them as sales on Dub:

- `customer.created`: When a new customer is created
- `customer.updated`: When a customer is updated
- `checkout.session.completed`: When a customer completes a checkout session
- `invoice.paid`: When an invoice is paid (for tracking recurring subscriptions)
- `charge.refunded`: When a charge is refunded (for tracking refunds and updating payout commissions for [Dub Partners](https://dub.partners))

## Tracking sales with the Dub Stripe integration

Depending on your setup, there are a few ways you can track sales with the Dub Stripe integration.

- [Option 1: Using Stripe Payment Links](#option-1%3A-using-stripe-payment-links)
- [Option 2: Using Stripe Checkout (recommended)](#option-2%3A-using-stripe-checkout-recommended)
- [Option 3: Using Stripe Customers](#option-3%3A-using-stripe-customers)

### Option 1: Using Stripe Payment Links

<Tip>
  For this option to work, you need to [install the Dub Stripe
  integration](#installing-the-dub-stripe-integration) and [enable conversion
  tracking for your
  links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1%3A-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
  first.
</Tip>

<Note>
  When using Stripe Payment Links, lead webhooks and [lead
  rewards](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-rewards#configuring-reward-types)
  are not created. Only sale events will be tracked.
</Note>

If you're using [Stripe Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links), simply add a `?dub_client_reference_id=1` query parameter to your Stripe Payment Link when shortening it on Dub.

Then, when a user clicks on the shortened link, Dub will automatically append the unique click ID as the `client_reference_id` [query parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters) to the payment link.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.dub.co/cms/conversions-payment-links.jpg"
    alt="Stripe payment link with Dub click ID"
  />
</Frame>

Finally, when the user completes the checkout flow, Dub will automatically [track the sale event](/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale) and [update the customer's `customerExternalId`](/api-reference/endpoint/update-a-customer) with their Stripe customer ID for future reference.

Alternatively, if you have a marketing site that you're redirecting your users to first, you can do this instead:

1. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction), which automatically detects the `dub_id` in the URL and stores it as a first-party cookie on your site.
2. Then, retrieve and append the `dub_id` value as the `client_reference_id` parameter to the payment links on your pricing page / CTA button (prefixed with `dub_id_`).

   ```
   https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxxx?client_reference_id=dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

<Accordion title="What if I'm using Stripe Pricing Tables?">
  If you're using [Stripe Pricing Tables](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table) – you'd want to pass the Dub click ID as a [`client-reference-id` attribute](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table#handle-fulfillment-with-the-stripe-api) instead:

  <CodeGroup>

```html HTML
<body>
  <h1>We offer plans that help any business!</h1>
  <!-- Paste your embed code script here. -->
  <script async src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/pricing-table.js"></script>
  <stripe-pricing-table
    pricing-table-id="{{PRICING_TABLE_ID}}"
    publishable-key="pk_test_51ODHJvFacAXKeDpJsgWLQJSzBIDtCUFN6MoB4IIXKJDfWdFmiEO4JuvAU1A0Y2Ri4m4q1egIfwYy3s72cUBRCwXC00GQhEZuXa"
    client-reference-id="dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  >
  </stripe-pricing-table>
</body>
```

```jsx React
import * as React from "react";

function PricingPage() {
  // Paste the stripe-pricing-table snippet in your React component
  return (
    <stripe-pricing-table
      pricing-table-id="'{{PRICING_TABLE_ID}}'"
      publishable-key="pk_test_51ODHJvFacAXKeDpJsgWLQJSzBIDtCUFN6MoB4IIXKJDfWdFmiEO4JuvAU1A0Y2Ri4m4q1egIfwYy3s72cUBRCwXC00GQhEZuXa"
      client-reference-id="dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ></stripe-pricing-table>
  );
}

export default PricingPage;
```

  </CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I'm using Stripe's Checkout Sessions API?">

If you're using Stripe's [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object) for a recurring subscription service, you might want to check out our [Stripe Checkout option](#option-2%3A-using-stripe-checkout-recommended) instead.

If your setup doesn't involve a [lead event](/conversions/leads/introduction) and goes straight to the Stripe checkout flow (e.g. for one-time purchases), you can simply pass the Dub click ID (prefixed with `dub_id_`) as the [`client_reference_id` parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-client_reference_id) to enable conversion tracking with Dub.

  <CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
  line_items: [
    {
      price: "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      quantity: 2,
    },
  ],
  mode: "payment",
  client_reference_id: "dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});
```

```python Python
  stripe.checkout.Session.create(
    success_url="https://example.com/success",
    line_items=[{"price": "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "quantity": 2}],
    mode="payment",
    client_reference_id="dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  )
```

```go Go
  params := &stripe.CheckoutSessionParams{
    SuccessURL: stripe.String("https://example.com/success"),
    LineItems: []*stripe.CheckoutSessionLineItemParams{
      &stripe.CheckoutSessionLineItemParams{
        Price: stripe.String("price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"),
        Quantity: stripe.Int64(2),
      },
    },
    Mode: stripe.String(string(stripe.CheckoutSessionModePayment)),
    ClientReferenceID: stripe.String("dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"),
  };
  result, err := session.New(params);
```

```php PHP
  $stripe->checkout->sessions->create([
    'success_url' => 'https://example.com/success',
    'line_items' => [
      [
        'price' => 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
        'quantity' => 2,
      ],
    ],
    'mode' => 'payment',
    'client_reference_id' => "dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  ]);
```

```ruby Ruby
  Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({
    success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
    line_items: [
      {
        price: 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
        quantity: 2,
      },
    ],
    mode: 'payment',
    client_reference_id: "dub_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  })
```

  </CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Option 2: Using Stripe Checkout (recommended)

If you have a custom checkout flow that uses Stripe's `checkout.sessions.create` API, you'd want to associate the [Stripe customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) with the user's unique ID in your database (which we tracked in the [lead conversion tracking step](/conversions/leads/introduction)).

This will allow Dub to automatically listen for purchase events from Stripe and associate them with the original click event (and by extension, the link that the user came from).

<Accordion title="How does this work?">

Remember in the [lead conversion tracking guide](/conversions/leads/introduction), we passed the user's unique user ID along with the click event ID in the `dub.track.lead` call?

```javascript Node.js
await dub.track.lead({
  clickId,
  eventName: "Sign Up",
  customerExternalId: user.id, // the unique user ID of the customer in your database
  customerName: user.name,
  customerEmail: user.email,
  customerAvatar: user.image,
});
```

Under the hood, Dub records the user as a customer and associates them with the click event that they came from.

Then, when the user makes a purchase, Dub will automatically associate the checkout session details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the customer – and by extension, the original click event.

</Accordion>

First, you'll need to complete the following prerequisites:

1. [Install the Dub Stripe integration](#installing-the-dub-stripe-integration)
2. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1%3A-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
3. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
4. [Install the Dub server-side SDK](/sdks/overview#server-side-sdks)

Then, when you [create a checkout session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create), pass your customer's unique user ID in your database as the `dubCustomerExternalId` value in the `metadata` field.

```javascript Node.js
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const priceId = "price_xxxxxxxxx";

const stripeSession = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  customer_email: user.email,
  success_url: "https://app.domain.com/success",
  line_items: [{ price: priceId, quantity: 1 }],
  mode: "subscription",
  client_reference_id: user.teamId,
  metadata: {
    dubCustomerExternalId: user.id, // the unique user ID of the customer in your database
  },
});
```

This way, when the customer completes their checkout session, Dub will automatically associate the checkout session details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the customer – and by extension, the original click event.

<Warning>
  If you're using [guest checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/guest-customers) (e.g. with `mode: "payment"`), the `customer` field in the `checkout.session.completed` webhook event will be `null`, and sales won't be tracked on Dub. 
  
  To fix this, set `customer_creation` to `always` when [creating your checkout session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer_creation):

```javascript Node.js
const stripeSession = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  // ... other options
  customer_creation: "always", // ensures a Stripe customer is created
});
```

</Warning>

### Option 3: Using Stripe Customers

<Note>
  When using Stripe Customers, [lead
  rewards](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-rewards#configuring-reward-types)
  are not created. Only lead events will be tracked.
</Note>

Alternatively, if you don't use Stripe's [checkout session creation flow](#option-2%3A-using-stripe-checkout-recommended), you can also pass the user ID and the click event ID (`dub_id`) in the [Stripe customer creation flow](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create).

First, you'll need to complete the following prerequisites:

1. [Install the Dub Stripe integration](#installing-the-dub-stripe-integration)
2. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1%3A-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
3. [Install the @dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)

Then, when you [create a Stripe customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create), pass the user's unique user ID in your database as the `dubCustomerExternalId` value in the `metadata` field.

```javascript Node.js
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const dub_id = req.headers.get("dub_id");

await stripe.customers.create({
  email: user.email,
  name: user.name,
  metadata: {
    dubCustomerExternalId: user.id,
    dubClickId: dub_id,
  },
});
```

Alternatively, you can also pass the `dubCustomerExternalId` and `dubClickId` values in the `metadata` field of the [Stripe customer update flow](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update):

```javascript Node.js
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const dub_id = req.headers.get("dub_id");

await stripe.customers.update(user.id, {
  metadata: {
    dubCustomerExternalId: user.id,
    dubClickId: dub_id,
  },
});
```

This way, when the customer makes a purchase, Dub will automatically associate the purchase details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the original click event.


## Tracking free trials

Dub supports tracking [subscription free trials](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials) as lead events on Dub. This is useful for products with free trials since you might want to track trial activations as part of your attribution flow.

To enable free trial tracking, go to your Stripe integration settings and enable the **Track Free Trials** option:


<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-integration-settings.png"
    alt="The Stripe integration settings page"
  />
</Frame>

Optionally, you can also configure the integration to track the [provisioned quantity](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/quantities) in the subscription as separate lead events. 

This is useful if you have a [lead-based reward](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-rewards#configuring-reward-types) for your [partner program](https://dub.co/partners) and want to reward partners for each unit of the subscription that their customers purchase (e.g. $50 per lead/provisioned seat).

<Tip>
To differentiate between [manually tracked lead events](/conversions/leads/introduction) and free trial lead events for lead reward types, use the `Customer` `Source` [reward condition](https://dub.co/help/article/partner-rewards#adding-reward-conditions) to filter for `free trial` lead events:



<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/lead-reward-free-trials.png"
    alt="The lead reward free trial condition"
  />
</Frame>
</Tip>

## Currency conversion support

If you're using [Stripe's Adaptive Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing) feature, Dub will record the sale amount using the currency of your Stripe account:

```json checkout.session.completed
// Stripe checkout.session.completed event payload
{
  "id": "{{EVENT_ID}}",
  "object": "event",
  "type": "checkout.session.completed",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "{{SESSION_ID}}",
      "object": "checkout.session",
      "currency": "cad",
      "amount_subtotal": 2055,
      "amount_total": 2055,
      "currency_conversion": {
        "amount_subtotal": 1500,
        "amount_total": 1500, // this is the amount that Dub will record
        "source_currency": "usd", // the currency of your Stripe account
        "fx_rate": "1.37"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you're not using Stripe Adaptive Pricing, Dub will record the sale amount in the default currency of your Dub workspace. This means that if you pass a different currency, it will be automatically converted to USD for reporting consistency – using the latest foreign exchange rates.

```json checkout.session.completed
// Stripe checkout.session.completed event payload
{
  "id": "{{EVENT_ID}}",
  "object": "event",
  "type": "checkout.session.completed",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "{{SESSION_ID}}",
      "object": "checkout.session",
      "currency": "cad",
      "amount_subtotal": 2055,
      "amount_total": 2055 // this will be converted from CAD to USD
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The default currency for all Dub workspaces is currently set to `USD`. We will
  add the ability to customize that in the future.
</Note>

## Tax handling

When tracking sale conversions from Stripe, Dub automatically excludes taxes from the final sale amount to ensure accurate revenue reporting.

For **checkout sessions**, Dub calculates the sale amount by subtracting the tax amount from the total:

```javascript
// Sale amount calculation for checkout sessions
saleAmount = amount_total - total_details.amount_tax;
```

For **invoices**, Dub uses the `total_excluding_tax` field when available:

```javascript
// Sale amount calculation for invoices
saleAmount = total_excluding_tax ?? amount_paid;
```

This ensures that the sale amounts recorded in Dub reflect the actual revenue before taxes, providing more accurate metrics for:

- Revenue tracking and reporting
- Partner commission calculations
- Analytics and conversion metrics

<Note>
  Tax amounts are automatically excluded from all sale events tracked through
  the Stripe integration, including one-time purchases, subscriptions, and
  recurring invoices.
</Note>
