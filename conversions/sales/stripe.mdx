When it comes to conversion tracking, a `sale` event happens when a user purchases your product or service. Examples include:

- Subscribing to a paid plan
- Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)
- Purchasing a product

In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sale events with Stripe as the payment processor by leveraging Dub's Stripe integration.

<SalesPrerequisites />

## Step 1: Enable the Stripe Integration on Dub

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Stripe integration page">
 Navigate to the [Stripe integration page](https://app.dub.co/integrations/stripe) in your Dub workspace.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable the Stripe integration">
Click on the "Enable" button to enable the Stripe integration, which will redirect you to the Stripe App installation flow.
</Step>

  />
</Frame>

<Step title="Install the Stripe app">
Select the Stripe account to install the app on, and select "Install App".

<Frame>
  <img

    alt="The Stripe integration installation flow"
  />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the installation">
  Once this is done, you will be redirected back to your Dub workspace and you
  should see that the integration is now installed.
</Step>

<Step title="Optional: Install the app in Stripe test mode">
Navigate to your [Stripe "Installed Apps" dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/dub.co) and verify that the Dub app is installed. We also recommmend installing the app in test mode to be able to test your end-to-end flow without using real money.

</Step>

</Steps>
Dub's Stripe integration will automatically forward the following events to Dub:

- `customer.created`: When a new customer is created
- `checkout.session.completed`: When a customer completes a checkout session
- `invoice.paid`: When an invoice is paid (for tracking recurring subscriptions)

## Step 2: Associate Stripe customer with your customer ID

Next, we'll need to associate the [Stripe customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) with the user ID in your database (which we tracked in the [lead conversion tracking step](/conversions/leads/introduction)).

This will allow Dub to automatically listen for purchase events from Stripe and associate them with the original click event (and by extension, the link that the user came from).

<Accordion title="How does this work?">

Remember in the [lead conversion tracking guide](/conversions/leads/next-auth), we passed the user's unique user ID along with the click event ID in the `dub.track.lead` call?

```typescript
await dub.track.lead({
  clickId,
  eventName: "Sign Up",
  customerId: user.id,
  customerName: user.name,
  customerEmail: user.email,
  customerAvatar: user.image,
});
```

Under the hood, Dub records the user as a customer and associates them with the click event that they came from.

Then, when the user makes a purchase, Dub will automatically associate the checkout session details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the customer – and by extension, the original click event.

</Accordion>

There are 2 ways to associate the Stripe customer object with the user ID in your database:

1. [Include your customer's unique user ID in checkout sessions](#option-1-include-your-customers-unique-user-id-in-checkout-sessions)
2. [Pass the user ID and the click event ID in the Stripe customer creation flow](#option-2-pass-the-user-id-and-the-click-event-id-in-the-stripe-customer-creation-flow)

### Option 1: Include your customer's unique user ID in checkout sessions

When you [create checkout sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create) for your users, pass your customer's unique user ID in your database as the `dubCustomerId` value in the `metadata` field.

```typescript app/api/upgrade/route.ts
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const priceId = "price_xxxxxxxxx";

const stripeSession = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  customer_email: user.email,
  success_url: "https://app.domain.com/success",
  line_items: [{ price: priceId, quantity: 1 }],
  mode: "subscription",
  client_reference_id: user.teamId,
  metadata: {
    dubCustomerId: user.id, // the unique user ID of the customer in your database
  },
});
```

### Option 2: Pass the user ID and the click event ID in the Stripe customer creation flow

Alternatively, if you don't use Stripe's checkout session creation flow, you can also pass the user ID and the click event ID (`dub_id`) in the [Stripe customer creation flow](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create):

```typescript app/api/create-customer/route.ts
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const dub_id = req.headers.get("dub_id");

await stripe.customers.create({
  email: user.email,
  name: user.name,
  metadata: {
    dubCustomerId: user.id,
    dubClickId: dub_id,
  },
});
```

## Step 3: View conversion results

And that's it – you're all set! You can now sit back, relax, and watch your conversion revenue grow. We provide 3 different views to help you understand your conversions:

- **Time-series**: A [time-series view](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics#1-time-series-analytics-chart) of the number clicks, leads and sales.

<Frame>

    alt="Time-series line chart"
  />
</Frame>

- **Funnel chart**: A funnel chart view visualizing the conversion & dropoff rates across the different steps in the conversion funnel (clicks → leads → sales).

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/conversions/funnel-chart.png"
    alt="Funnel chart view showing the conversion & dropoff rates from clicks → leads → sales"
  />
</Frame>

- **Real-time events stream**: A [real-time events stream](https://dub.co/help/article/real-time-events-stream) of every single conversion event that occurs across all your links in your workspace.
