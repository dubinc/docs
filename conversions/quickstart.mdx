In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with conversion tracking on Dub.

## Conversion tracking flows

Dub supports two conversion tracking flows:

1. **Traditional flow**: Click → Lead → Sale (recommended for most use cases)
2. **Direct sale tracking**: Click → Sale (useful for one-time purchases and e-commerce)

## Step 1: Enable conversion tracking for your links

<EnableConversionTracking />

## Step 2: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK

Next, you'll need to install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

This script detects the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.
