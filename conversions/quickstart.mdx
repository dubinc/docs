<Note>
  Conversion tracking requires a [Business plan](https://dub.co/pricing)
  subscription or higher.
</Note>

Dub's powerful [attribution platform](https://dub.co/analytics) lets you understand how well your links are translating to actual users and revenue dollars.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with conversion tracking on Dub.

## Step 1: Enable conversion tracking for your links

<EnableConversionTracking />

You'll also need to generate a publishable key and allowlist your site's domain to ensure client-side events are ingested by Dub. Navigate to your workspace's Analytics settings page to configure these options.

<OpenAnalyticsSettings />

## Step 2: Install the `@dub/analytics` client-side SDK

Next, you'll need to install the [@dub/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

This script detects the `dub_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.
