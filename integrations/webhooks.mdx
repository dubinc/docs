<Note>
  Dub Webhooks are currently in closed beta and would require a [Business
  plan](https://dub.co/help/article/business-plan) subscription and above. If
  you'd like to join the beta, [reach out to us via
  email](mailto:support@dub.co?subject=I%20want%20to%20join%20the%20Dub%20Webhooks%20beta).
</Note>

Webhooks allows you to listen to real-time events happening across your Dub workspace. With webhooks, you can build custom integrations with Dub, such as:

- Triggering a Zap on [Zapier](https://app.dub.co/integrations/zapier) when a new link is created in Dub
- Send a notification on [Slack](https://app.dub.co/integrations/slack) when a link is clicked
- For building gamified referral programs with [Dub Conversions](/conversions/quickstart) – e.g. increment usage credits for both the referrer and referee when a conversion event happens

In this guide, we'll show you how to configure webhooks for your Dub workspace and a list of available events you can listen to.

## Creating a webhook

To create a webhook for your Dub workspace, you'll need to follow these steps:

Navigate to the [**Webhooks** settings page](https://app.dub.co/webhooks) in your Dub workspace.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/create-webhook.png" alt="Create Webhook" />
</Frame>

Click on **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/create-webhook-form.png" alt="Create Webhook Form" />
</Frame>

Fill in the required fields in the webhook creation form:

1. **Name**: Give your webhook a name that helps you identify it.
2. **URL**: Enter the URL of the endpoint where you want to send the webhook. We recommend using [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to test your webhook.
3. **Signing secret**: This is an auto-generated secret key that you can use to verify the authenticity of the webhook in your application.
4. **Events**: Select the events you want to listen to. You can select multiple events. Refer to the [Available Events](#available-events) section to see the list of available events.

Finally, click on **Create webhook** to create the webhook.

## Available webhook events

When setting up a webhook, you can select the events you want to listen to across your Dub workspace. There are two types of events you can listen to:

- **Workspace-level events**: These events are triggered in the context of your entire workspace.
- **Link-level events**: These events are triggered in the context of a specific link.

### Workspace-level events

These events are triggered in the context of your entire workspace:

### Link-level events

Due to the high volume nature of these events, they are scoped to a specific link.

This means that you need to specify the link when creating a webhook – though you can select multiple links for the same webhook if you'd like.

<Accordion title="link.clicked">

This event is triggered when a user clicks on a link. The event payload contains all the details about the click event.

Here's an example payload:

```json link.clicked

## Sending test events

You can send test events to your webhook URL to ensure that it's working correctly. To do this:

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to the webhook details page">
Navigate to the [**Webhooks** settings page](https://app.dub.co/webhooks) and select the webhook you want to test.

Click on the **Update Details** tab to open the webhook details page.

</Step>
<Step title="Open the test event modal">
Select the `⋮` icon on the top right of the page, and click on **Send test event**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/send-test-event.png" alt="Send Test Event" />
</Frame>

This will open up a modal where you can select the event you want to send.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/send-test-event-modal.png" alt="Send Test Event Modal" />
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Send the test event">
  Select the event you want to send, and click on **Send test webhook**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/send-test-webhook.png" alt="Send Test Webhook" />
</Frame>

You'll see a success message and receive the webhook event in the webhook endpoint you specified.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Viewing webhook event logs

We also provide you with a webhook event logs page where you can view all the webhook events that have been sent to your webhook endpoint in real-time.

To view the webhook event logs, select the webhook from the [**Webhooks** settings page](https://app.dub.co/webhooks) and click on the **Webhook Logs** tab.

Here, you'll see a list of all the webhook events that have been sent to your webhook endpoint:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/webhook-event-logs.png" alt="Webhook Event Logs" />
</Frame>

You can also select on a specific event, which will open up a sheet with more details about the event:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/webhook-event-logs-details.png"
    alt="Webhook Event Logs Details"
  />
</Frame>

## Retry Behaviour

If your webhook endpoint does not respond with a success status code (2XX), we retry the request to ensure every message will be delivered.

Webhooks are retried 3 times with an exponential backoff. You can see all the retry attempts in the webhook event logs.

## Signature Verification

With signature verification, you can determine if the webhook came from Dub, and has not been tampered with in transit.

All webhooks are delivered with a `Dub-Signature` header. Dub generates this header using a secret key that only you and Dub know.

An example header looks like this:

```
Dub-Signature: c9ed6a2abf93f59d761eea69908d8de00f4437b5b6d7cd8b9bf5719cbe61bf46
```

To verify, you can use the secret key to generate your own signature for each webhook. If both signatures match then you can be sure that a received event came from Dub.

The steps required are:

1. Get the raw body of the request.
2. Extract the signature from the `Dub-Signature` header.
3. Calculate the HMAC of the raw body using the `SHA-256` hash function and the secret.
4. Compare the calculated `HMAC` with the one sent in the `Dub-Signature` header. If they match, the webhook is verified.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Next.js
export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
  const webhookSignature = req.headers.get("Dub-Signature");
  if (!webhookSignature) {
    return new Response("No signature provided.", { status: 401 });
  }

  // Copy this from the webhook details page
  const secret = process.env.DUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
  if (!secret) {
    return new Response("No secret provided.", { status: 401 });
  }

  // Make sure to get the raw body from the request
  const rawBody = await req.text();

  const computedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(rawBody)
    .digest("hex");

  if (webhookSignature !== computedSignature) {
    return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 400 });
  }

  # Handle the webhook event
  # ...
};
```

```python Python
import hmac
import hashlib

def webhook():
    # Get the signature from the header
    webhook_signature = request.headers.get('Dub-Signature')
    if not webhook_signature:
        abort(401, 'No signature provided.')

    # Copy this from the webhook details page
    secret = os.environ.get('DUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
    if not secret:
        abort(401, 'No secret provided.')

    # Get the raw body of the request
    raw_body = request.data

    # Calculate the HMAC
    computed_signature = hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        raw_body,
