Understanding the core data models is key to using the Dub API and platform effectively. All data in Dub belongs to a Workspace, which acts as the top-level container for your organization.

This page provides a conceptual overview of the primary entities you'll interact with and how they relate to each other, whether you're using the [Dub dashboard](https://app.dub.co) or the [Dub API](/api-reference/introduction).

## Core Entities

The following table defines the primary data models in Dub:

| Entity         | Description                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace**  | The top-level container for all your data. Invite team members, manage roles, and configure billing here.        |
| **Program**    | A partner program you create with configurable reward rules, commission structures, and enrolled partners.       |
| **Partner**    | A user who joined a program. They receive a unique referral link and can earn commissions on conversions.        |
| **Link**       | A short link that redirects to a destination URL. Can be standalone or associated with a partner for tracking.   |
| **Analytics**  | Aggregated data about link performance including clicks, geographic location, devices, referrers, and UTMs.      |
| **Customer**   | An end-user who clicked a partner's link and converted (e.g., signed up or made a purchase).                     |
| **Commission** | A record of a successful conversion attributed to a partner, with a status (pending, approved, paid) and amount. |
| **Domain**     | A custom domain for branded short links. Improves brand recognition and click-through rates.                     |
| **Tag**        | A label to organize, filter, and group links for easier management and analytics segmentation.                   |

## Key Relationships

The relationships between entities follow a clear hierarchy:

1. **Workspace → Program**: A workspace can have multiple partner programs. Each program operates independently with its own reward rules and partners.

2. **Program → Partner**: Partners join a specific program. A single user could be a partner in multiple programs across different workspaces.

3. **Partner → Link**: When a partner joins a program, they receive a unique referral link. This link is used to track all referrals back to that partner.

4. **Link → Customer**: When a visitor clicks a partner's link and converts, they become a Customer. The customer is permanently associated with the referring link.

5. **Customer → Commission**: Each qualifying action by a customer (e.g., a purchase) generates a Commission record for the partner who referred them.
