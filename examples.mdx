## Dub Links

With Dub's [API](/api-reference/introduction), you can integrate Dub's link infrastructure into your application. This includes use cases like:

- Programmatically creating short links
- Using OAuth 2.0 to authenticate with Dub

With Dub's powerful [Analytics API](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-analytics), you can access real-time analytics data for your links. This allows you to build user-facing analytics dashboards, a la the ones on [OSS Gallery](https://oss.gallery/projects/dub).

## Dub Conversions

With [Dub Conversions](/conversions/quickstart), you can build white-labeled referral dashboards that live directly in your application (leveraging our [Analytics API](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-analytics) as well).

You can also combine Dub Conversions with [Webhooks](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) to build custom referral workflows:

- give both the referrer and referee 1 month free of your product
- send a swag link when a user reaches 5 referrals
