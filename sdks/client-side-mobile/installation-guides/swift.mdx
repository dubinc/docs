   your domain (`DUB_DOMAIN`) from your [workspace's Custom Domains settings page](https://app.dub.co/links/domains).

2. (Optional) If you plan to track conversions, follow the [Dub Conversions quickstart guide](/conversions/quickstart) to [enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1%3A-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links).
