This page provides a high-level, conceptual overview of how the Dub platform works, focusing on the end-to-end flow of the Dub Partners product.

## The Core Flow

The partner lifecycle consists of five key stages:

1. **Program Creation**: A user (the "Program Owner") creates a Partner Program in their Dub workspace.

2. **Partner Onboarding**: A partner discovers the program and is invited or signs up. They get a unique referral link.

3. **Link Sharing**: The partner shares their unique link on their website, social media, etc.

4. **Visitor Click & Conversion**: A visitor clicks the link. The `@dub/analytics` script attributes the click to the partner. The visitor then converts (e.g., signs up, makes a purchase).

5. **Commission & Payout**: A commission is generated for the partner. The Program Owner can then pay out all partners with 1-click global payouts.

## Generate Your Script

Before tracking conversions, you need to install the [`@dub/analytics`](/sdks/client-side/introduction) script on your website. This lightweight script detects when visitors arrive via a Dub link and stores a first-party cookie for attribution.

To get started:

1. Navigate to your workspace's Analytics settings page
2. Generate a [publishable key](/api-reference/publishable-keys) for client-side authentication
3. Allowlist the domains where you'll install the script

<OpenAnalyticsSettings />

Once configured, follow one of the [installation guides](/sdks/client-side/introduction#installation-guides) to add the script to your site.

## Integration Options

At Stage 4 (Visitor Click & Conversion), you'll need to track when visitors convert. Dub offers multiple integration paths:
