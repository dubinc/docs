Dub's API rate limiting is in conformance with the [IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers):

| Header Name             | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.              |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.    |
| `Retry-After`           | The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request again.                |

Dub's API is capped at **60 requests per minute** per key on the Free plan, with elevated limits for [Pro plan](https://dub.co/help/article/pro-plan) and above.

This is implemented to ensure a fair usage policy so that excessive use by a single user does not adversely affect the performance and usage of the API by others.

You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the rate limit is exceeded.

## Rate limits by plan

Depending on your Dub plan, you can expect the following rate limits:

| Plan                                                  | Rate limit                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Free                                                  | 60 requests per minute                                                  |
| [Pro](https://dub.co/pricing)           		| 600 requests per minute                                                 |
| [Business](https://dub.co/pricing) 			| 1,200 requests per minute                                               |
| [Advanced](https://dub.co/pricing) 			| 3,000 requests per minute                                               |

## How to comply with rate limits

Here are some tips on how you can optimize your API setup to comply with our rate limits:

### 1. Bulk link creation

If you need to create a lot of links within a short period of time, try our [bulk link creation endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/bulk-create-links) instead (create up to 100 links in one API call)

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
await dub.links.createMany([
  {
    url: "https://google.com",
  },
  {
    url: "https://twitter.com",
  },
  {
    url: "https://linkedin.com",
  },
]);
```

```python Python
res = d.links.create_many(request=[
  {
    url: "https://google.com",
  },
  {
    url: "https://twitter.com",
  },
  {
    url: "https://linkedin.com",
  },
]);
```

```go Go
var request []operations.RequestBody =
  []operations.RequestBody{
    operations.RequestBody{
        URL: "https://google.com",
    },
    operations.RequestBody{
      URL: "https://twitter.com",
    },
    operations.RequestBody{
      URL: "https://linkedin.com",
    },
  }
ctx := context.Background()
res, err := s.Links.CreateMany(ctx, request)
```

```ruby Ruby
s.links.create_many(
  ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::BulkCreateLinksRequest.new(
    request_body: [
      ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RequestBody.new(
        url: "https://google.com",
      ),
      ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RequestBody.new(
        url: "https://twitter.com",
      ),
      ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RequestBody.new(
        url: "https://linkedin.com",
      ),
    ]
  )
)
```

</CodeGroup>
    
### 2. Fetch workspace-level analytics

If you're using our [Analytics API](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-analytics), instead of retrieving the clicks count for every single link, try making a single API call to get workspace-level click analytics instead.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
await dub.analytics.retrieve({
  groupBy: "top_links",
  start: "4 hours ago", // we support natural language for start/end params
});
```

```python Python
res = d.analytics.retrieve(request={
    "groupBy": "top_links",
    "start": "4 hours ago", // we support natural language for start/end params
})
```

```go Go
func main() {
	// Retrieve the timeseries analytics for the last 7 days for a link
	request := operations.RetrieveAnalyticsRequest{
        GroupBy: "top_links",
        Start: "4 hours ago", // we support natural language for start/end params
	}

	ctx := context.Background()
	res, err := d.Analytics.Retrieve(ctx, request)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	if res.OneOf != nil {
		// handle response
	}
}
```

```ruby Ruby
req = ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::RetrieveAnalyticsRequest.new(
  group_by: ::OpenApiSDK::Operations::GroupBy::TOP_LINKS,
  start: "4 hours ago", // we support natural language for start/end params
)

res = dub.analytics.retrieve(req)

puts res.raw_response.body
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Leverage webhooks

If you're expecting high volume, fast-changing data (e.g. thousands of clicks on your links per day) and would prefer to store the data on your end, we recommend using our [real-time webhooks feature](https://dub.co/blog/introducing-webhooks) instead.

[Webhooks](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) are _push-based_, meaning that Dub will send events to your webhook receiver endpoint when specific events occur, while a REST API is _pull-based_, meaning that you need to consistently poll the API endpoint to get real-time updates.

Check out our [webhooks documentation](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) to learn more.
