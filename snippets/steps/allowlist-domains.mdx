<Step title="Allowlist your site's domain">

Then, you'll need to allowlist your site's domain to allow the client-side conversion events to be ingested by Dub.

Navigate to your workspace's Analytics settings page and add your site's domain to the **Allowed Hostnames** list.

<Card

  Configure allowed hostnames in the dashboard
</Card>

This provides an additional layer of security by ensuring only authorized domains can track conversions using your publishable key.

You can group your hostnames when adding them to the allow list:

- `example.com`: Tracks traffic **only** from `example.com`.
- `*.example.com`: Tracks traffic from **all subdomains** of `example.com`, but **not** from `example.com` itself.

<Tip>
  When testing things out locally, you can add `localhost` to the **Allowed
  Hostnames** list temporarily. This will allow local events to be ingested by
  Dub. Don't forget to remove it once you're ready to go live!
