Dub is the modern link attribution platform for you to create short links, track conversion analytics, and run affiliate programs.

Our mission is to reimagine the role of links – one of the most foundational pieces of the web – from being a simple **"resource locator"** (URL) to a full **attribution engine** – visualizing the user journey from the first click to the final conversion event.
